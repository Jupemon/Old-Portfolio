## Old-Portfolio
My portfolio site which contains detailed descriptions of the projects i have created, and a blog which i write

## Please read!
I plan on recreating this entire portfolio site with nextJS. With nextJS i can combine server, database and front end client into one convinient box.
I will also add improved way to write blogs and project descriptions. Currently with my old portfolio i have to push code any time i want to add a new project or blog entry.
I plan to implement proper bloggin functionalities with the new site.
